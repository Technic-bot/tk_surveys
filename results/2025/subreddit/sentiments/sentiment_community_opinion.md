| I thinks it is pretty cool, a good amount of fanart and good discussion on different topics.                                                                                                                                                          |

| I think it was pretty great. The subreddit, in particular, has a lot of really supportive people and new artists that became friends of mine                                                                                                          |

| I like them, the art this year has been great and the community is chill.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| It's been a good year so far! I'll keep enjoying it so long I stick to the Reddit                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Creative, more artists, 2D and 3D, coming onto the subreddit/scene                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| I haven't been here long, but I do enjoy the art I see on occasion. It does take me by surprise that the amount of fan content isn't huge, since every time I've heard this webcomic mentioned it's regarded as the biggest furry webcomic ever lol.  |
| This year feels okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| I personally love both the comic and its community. The comic has changed the path of my life for the better, and while I dont interact much with the community, the few interactions I have had have been great                                      |
| active, friendly, but not without drama                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| It attracts all types, I'll say that, but that's what's so nice about it too                                                                                                                                                                          |
| pretty decent I guess? I like the comic but I don’t engage much with the community besides the fan art                                                                                                                                                |
| I really like how the community developed and can’t wait to get more comic pages                                                                                                                                                                      |
| I think i feel older than the average person in the community. Very nice people, regardless.                                                                                                                                                          |

| I like it reminds me of fairy tale, older anime, movies, shows and books I grow up with. The community honestly it's.... kind of a hit or miss, the emotion is combination between loneliness, degeneracy, happiness, angriness, sadness and comedic. |
