| Cats. Undrlying menace of a plot                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| The world and world building. Some moments in the comic are pretty good when they get good (Basitin Isles arc, Edinmire Arrival arc, Manor arc, Assassin brothers encounter arc). The art (especially in the later chapters) is really great as well. |
| I really liked the fun 2000s fantasy (almost jrpg vibes) that the early chapters had. The new stuff is good too! The whole “cute girls doing cute things” has its place as well                                                                       |
| It's well developed and intriguing, and I like these kinds of comic stories.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| I enjoy the character relationships and the community, they’re all very talented and I enjoy it whenever fanart sprouts up.                                                                                                                           |
| I like the character design                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| The writing of the characters for some reason really connects with me on a very emotional level                                                                                                                                                       |
| great place for art to prosper                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| The tangible development of the writing and art over the years, it's really fascinating to go back and see how far Tom has come as an artist and creator.                                                                                             |
| Its progression. How it went from a simple, silly tale in the beginning to the mature story it is now. Seeing over two decades worth of art and story development really stuck the world and its characters into my mind and inspired me.             |
| The setting, even though it isnt the most well written setting at all, it has an appeal with how tom has written it and built it in the past.                                                                                                         |
| I like the comedic character interactions, especially the awkward/horny ones.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| The best part about Twokinds is probably it's community                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| The art is wonderful and the emotions are rich.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| The art evolution, and also the characters. I don't think the story is particularly groundbreaking but I DO really like the characters.                                                                                                               |
| The funny moments and drama                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Hot furry man, hot furry women, hot humans.... Personality and surprisingly good characteristic development. And characters you will love them for a lot of reasons. not from looks, but who they are, and what they are.                             |
| I love the diverse cast of characters!                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| The characters, story and toms beautiful art!                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| A consistent storyline with excellent art, a rarity nowadays in an era of AI slop and shitty “story beats” that were put in for the sake of a quota. This is truly original and Tom has not deviated from this, even owning his mistakes.             |
| Great story and hot+loveable characters tbh                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| I love the theme of characters having dual backgrounds and how the world and its different inhabitants view and treat them. Internalized hatred is a theme explored in the comic.                                                                     |
