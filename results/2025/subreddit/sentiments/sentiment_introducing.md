| The first thing I show a newbie is the history of the main characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| I sent them the link to page 1 after describing very vaguely what I like.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| I would tell them about it and show the different pages throughout the years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Probably through one of the coloured picarto artworks, then direct them to the comic if they're interested.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Tell them Markiplier's brother has been making the comic for a long time and show a brief comparison between how it looks now to how it started                                                                                                                                                           |
| i have no idea how id show it to anyone without weirding them out                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Show them the art progression and relate the world and story to other fantasy stories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Depends, if they're willing to slog through the lesser portions of the story I'd show them chapter 7 and let them get to the Basitin Islands arc, otherwise I'd start them at chapter 10 and fill them in as they read                                                                                    |
| I would probably ask them if they like fantasy or adventure. Then I would mention the story and then, if the person is interested, I would introduce it.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Have you ever heard of this comic called, Twokinds?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| I would explain the rough premise of the story (without spoiling anything) and ask them to give it a shot and at least get through the first few chapters until Basitine island.                                                                                                                          |
| I would talk about its meaning to me personally, how I read the first 17 or so chapters out at the time in 1 sitting on my first read, how it made me feel emotions I didnt get other places in my life, and then show them the physical copies I have                                                    |
| introduce them to the first page and see if they like it (which is how I started), and maybe show some of my favourite art/mini side comics                                                                                                                                                               |
| I would ask them if they knew if Markiplier had a brother                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| If I had to, I'd show them art of the characters first, then a couple of better drawn chapters to get them hooked                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Furry and manga crossover, I’d show them official sketches                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| I'd probably mention it's runtime, how it was made by a 16 year old and still runs to this day. I'd also show comparisons to first appearance to most recent appearance of characters.                                                                                                                    |
| Maybe start them on chp 16-18 and if they like it start them at the beginning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| I would show them some of Tom's artwork and see if they like it. I then tell them the gist of the comic and before I recommend reading it, I will bring up some caveats of the comic arising from it being made by a cishet man when he was 17. There are some clumsy handlings of gender, race, and sex. |
| The first thing I would show to someone new is difference of new chapters to the old ones                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Some non canon artwork                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| It’s hard to say. I’d show them the main four first, since they are the classic quartet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| If I knew they wouldn't react poorly, I would try to show them a few cool pages or try to give a vague synopsis on the story                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Any new chapter that wouldn't reveal the plot. At least that's what influenced me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| I usually tell people that the first couple chapters are not 100% necessary because some elements (feral Keidran, masks, specific Templars) don’t really get revisited                                                                                                                                    |
| Try to get them to read the comic I guess 😅                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| I will not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| I don't recommend these things to people                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Probably suggest it and show some smaller side comics first                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| "It is kinda like manga"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Probably with that one Natani side comic, because it's a prologue and a lot less rough than the first few chapters                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Memes, no elaboration needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| I would show them the first page, then likely a more recent page to illustrate the progress that's been made. Even though it starts rough, I think it's worth it.                                                                                                                                         |
| I’d start with some artworks and sketches and if the person is still interested after some time I'd introduce them to the comic                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Imagine Harry DuBois except he actually is the culprit and he is in his 20s and not a drunk and instead of shooting a dude he commited genocide but now has a girlfriend of the genocided peoples and several friends also. Oh and it's horny. Prepare to see butts.                                      |
| I'd show them a few pages from the recent chapters (spoiler free of course) to show them what's to come, than give a quick summary of the first few chapters.                                                                                                                                             |
| honestly, I don’t know lol. Maybe an anniversary poster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Probably describe the lore of the comic first, show some sketches made by Tom, before showing the first pages of the comic... they are a bit outdated nowadays haha.                                                                                                                                      |
| Just tell them about it and hope they're not turned away but the aged beginning -- maybe by showing them more modern artwork first                                                                                                                                                                        |
| I'd show some of the non-spoiler sketches and mention some of the thing they might resonate with the most without giving everything away. Would warn that the early writing shows it was done by a teenager but it grows along with its author.                                                           |
| Probably just present it to them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
