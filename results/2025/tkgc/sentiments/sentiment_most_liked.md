| Natani’s character arc of rediscovering and being more confident in his manhood, also the improvement on the way he’s written mirrors that of the comic itself                                                                                   |
| It has an amazing story and great art.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Tom's beautiful artstyle developped over the years; when reading through the entire comic it feels not only like reading a story but also witnessing an artist's journey in self-improvement. It's what inspired me to keep trying to learn art. |
| I love how the character grow over time and become more fleshed out. I have known these characters for years.                                                                                                                                    |
| A lot of things, but in general. How it makes me feel, I feel like I am with the characters in the good and the bad moments.                                                                                                                     |
