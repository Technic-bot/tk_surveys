| Well first I'd have to find someone who's looking for a new furry webcomic to read that HASN'T found Twokinds yet...so yeah, impossible challenge much?                                                                                                                                                    |
| Voiced group read through. Did that with a couple of friends for a laugh and now they're all invested, was also really good fun.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| I would show them the first chapter and let them know that part of the appeal is that the story and art grow with the author over time.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| I'd start with showing them the first chapter of the comic and giving a synopsis of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| "Check out this webcomic. Yes, the starting art is old and not great, but it gets WAY better, I promise."                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Some of  Tom's art - amazing BGs, emotional art, rarely "questionable" art, one of the newest pages, redraw of page 1/technically page 0; say the plot's cool; Tom's doing this since being a 13-14yo (~02/03) - the art at the start might not be the best, but gets better later on, ~Basitin Island arc |

| Probably would not try unless he was into similar media. In which case i would show them the boat arc.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Probably one of the later pages because the art was pretty rough at first. If they're members of the furry fandom, I'm sure they'll quickly take a liking to it. Otherwise, it might be harder to convince them to read it.                                                                                |
| The easiest way would be to link them to the comic.
