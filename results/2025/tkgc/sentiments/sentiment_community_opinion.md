| It's nice and active, especially with Tom pushing good amount of pages. Keeps the discussions and speculations fresh.                                                                                                                                     |

| I’m excited to see more progress on the comic versus last year. I’m kinda bummed to hear that voting for Sunday sketches is no more and people were manipulating it.                                                                                      |

| not as nice as it used to be. Lots of indifference, parroting, lack of critical thinking, short attention spans, some come off as insensitive. Difficult to feel safe enough to express my opinion anymore without feeling invalidated.                   |
| Tom should lock in on the comic, not sketches.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| I have mixed feelings about this community, it’s a love/hate relationship: I love the queer fanart and most of the artwork of the cast, but the way many people here act towards queerness (especially with Natani) is at best with excessive skepticism. |
