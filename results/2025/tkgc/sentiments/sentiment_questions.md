| Maybe some could allow for longer answers / become multiple choices (allow ppl to rank fav chars in case sb has more than 1 — idk, 0-10 with 0 being unsure? same goes for least favs). |
| Btw Custom Pledge feels too general - some select it 'cuz they'd go for +10$, others 'cuz they'd go <10 or even <5$.                                                                    |

| Would you rather Tom took his time with the story writing, (not artistically speaking) or would you rather he just rush it even if the quality and character development will suffer?   |
| idk, I ain't good at this kind of stuff. XD                                                                                                                                             |
